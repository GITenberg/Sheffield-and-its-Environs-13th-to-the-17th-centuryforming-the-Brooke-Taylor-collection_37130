<h2 class="gap2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>My thanks are due to Colonel H. Brooke Taylor, for permission to search his
chambers in the Town Hall at Bakewell for hidden treasure, in the shape of
pre-reformation land charters court rolls and the like; to Mr Robert Shirley of
Waterhouse Farm near Longnor, for a sight of his title deeds to Hawksyard;
to his son Mr Edwin Leslie Shirley of Hawksyard, for a very pleasant visit to
his ancestral home in The Moorlands of Staffordshire, with its medieval tradition
and interesting associations; and to Mr James R. Wigfull, for an excellent little
map of Hawksyard and the surrounding country.</p>

<p>It is only through the kindness and good nature of others, that a systematic
search for local history can proceed and although contributions accumulate in
small quantities, there is no more fruitful or reliable source of information, as
to people and places of bygone days, than the land charters and court rolls covering
the period from the Domesday survey to the reformation.</p>

<p>Many bundles of old title deeds, unopened for centuries, yet lie hidden in
out-of-the-way corners and on inaccessible shelves; it should be part of the work
of every archæological society to extract from all available deeds, relating to
its own district, whatever useful history they may contain.</p>

<p>Every countryside, every village and every town becomes a more interesting
place to its inhabitants, when its history is known. The names of persons and
places become intelligible, dates and letters on buildings can be accounted for, disused
bridle roads and paths can be traced, the heraldry of the stained glass in the
church and of the tombstones in the churchyard can be read with understanding,
local genealogies can be extended and long cherished family traditions can often
be verified or explained.</p>

<p>It is therefore of importance that whenever these ancient writings make their
appearance, there should be some person or association of persons ready and
willing to examine them, not only with the object of extracting any local history
they may contain, but also of recording it in a form suitable for future reference.</p>

<p>13th century. Prior to the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>, 18 Edw I (1290). <b>Charter</b>
(Lat) confirming a grant from Jordan son of Thomas de Pickeburne to Gilbert
Cook of Rickehale, for a certain sum of money, which he gave to the grantor by
hand as a fine (<i>in gersumma</i>), of one acre of land and a half, with the appurtenances,
in the north field of Pickeburne at the green hill, lying between the
proper land of the grantor on the one part and land which Jordan Wlm' formerly
held on the other part; of which one end butted upon the field of Hanepol and
the other end on land of Sir Marmeduke Darel; and also a plot of meadow ground
in the meadows of Pickeburne; to wit, it lay in length and in breadth one rod and
three quarters, between the meadow of the fee of Rockelay and the meadow of
Robert Knou&#x1e8f;s, of which one end butted upon the south cave (<i>antrum australe</i>)
and the other end upon the north cave (<i>antrum boreale</i>); to hold and to have of
the grantor and his heirs to the said Gilbert and his heirs or whomsoever; and
howsoever and whatsoever time he should wish to give, to bequeath, to assign or
to sell, in fee and inheritance free quietly peacefully and entirely; with all rights
of common, easements, liberties and appurtenances, without reservation; paying
thenceforth annually to the grantor and his heirs one halfpenny of silver on the
day of saint John the baptist, for all secular services, exactions, taxes, suits of
court and demands; warranty of title etc. <b>Witnesses</b>: Helias de Scauceby,
Thomas his son, Henry of the same place, William Joye of Pickeburne, Hugh
son of Beatrice, Thomas Fossard of the same place (<i>sic</i>), William de Fonte.
<b>Vellum</b>: one skin 6&frac12; × 4, seal missing. <b>Notes</b>: this interesting charter, of which
a photographic reproduction is given as a frontispiece, is in perfect condition,
except that the seal is missing. It is a subinfeudation of lands in the township of
Pickburn-with-Brodsworth, in the parish of Brodsworth and wapentake of Strafforth,
four miles north-west of Doncaster; for which Gilbert Cook paid a gersuma
or fine to Jordan de Pickburn. In the reign of Edward the confessor, Pickburn
was part of the lands of Alsie the Saxon lord; but after the conquest it was held
by Nigel Fossard under the earl of Morton, who accompanied William from
Normandy in his successful invasion of England. The earl subsequently forfeited
his English possessions and Nigel Fossard, his subinfeudatory, came to be acknowledged
tenant of the crown. Gilbert Cook may have been descended from Alberus
de Coci (Cook), who after the conquest held Hickleton and part of Cadeby. No
trace of Rickehale can be found. Jordan Wlm' is clearly written, probably it is a
contraction of Woolmer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Hanepol is mentioned in Domesday, it was a manor before the conquest,
belonging to Swein. The modern name is Hampole and it lies about two miles
north of Pickburn.</p>

<p>Sir Marmeduke Darel was living 31 Hen III (1247), in which year he had a
charter of free warren at Brodsworth. The Darels got Brodsworth from the
de Buslis; they continued in possession from the beginning of the 13th to the
beginning of the 16th century; the last of the Darels being Sir Thomas, who died
without issue 23rd November 1505; see &#x201c;South Yorkshire&#x201d; vol I, page 315.</p>

<p>The fee of Rockley was in Worsborough and this land near Pickburn must
have adjoined part of that fee. The Rockleys were settled in Worsborough at the
time of the conquest and continued in undisturbed possession until the civil wars.
Knou&#x1e8f;s may in later times have been Knovis. Scauceby now Scawsby, lies two
miles south-east of Pickburn. It appears to have been a more important place in
Saxon times than it is to-day. It is mentioned in Domesday as Scalchebi. Helias
may mean Ellis. The surname Joye has a small i for the initial letter.</p>

<p>Nigel Fossard above mentioned was, after the death of the earl of Morton,
one of several landowners in the deanery of Doncaster who held direct from the
crown; his fee included lands at Brodsworth and he also had a house at Doncaster;
but his baronial seat was Mulgrave Castle in north Yorkshire.</p>

<p>William de Fonte was probably the prior of Ecclesfield, which priory belonged
at the date of this charter to the abbey of Fontenelle or saint Wandrille in Normandy.</p>

<p>Probably William de Fonte engrossed this charter and added his name as
the last witness, which was a common practice of monks and scriveners.</p>

<p>Judith, niece of William I and wife of earl Waltheof lord of Hallam, placed
a colony of monks from Fontenelle at Ecclesfield; probably in the 11th century,
as she was married in 1070; see &#x201c;Archæologia&#x201d; vol 26, page 352. From charter-evidence
it is certain that the priory was in existence in 1141. From this it may
be assumed that this beautifully written charter had its origin in Ecclesfield priory,
and was taken by prior William to Pickburn, where the other witnesses would
meet, to see possession of the land given and the grant confirmed by deed.</p>

<p>13th century. Prior to the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>, 18 Edw I (1290). <b>Charter</b>
(Lat) confirming a grant from William de Mertone to Henry son of Roger Palmer,
of one toft in the town of Mertone and two acres of his land; that toft and those
acres which Roger his son formerly held of him to the end of all things; to wit,
the said Roger the said land either held or retained, for homage and services;
to have and to hold to him and his heirs or assigns, from him (the grantor) or his
heirs, freely quietly and entirely, with all liberties and easements, so much land in
the town of Mertone, with the appurtenances; paying thenceforth annually himself
or his heirs or assigns to him (the grantor) and his heirs, one pound of cummin
at the feast of saint Michael the archangel, for all services exactions and demands;
and he William and his heirs, the said land, with the appurtenances, to the said
Henry and his heirs or assigns, against all men and women, did warrant for ever.
<b>Witnesses</b>: Richard de Thorintone, Adam de Pultone, James de Poltone (<i>sic</i>),
Henry de Karletone, Roger son of John de (?)aynol, Emery (<i>Aumaricus</i>) de
Lekamtone and others. <b>Vellum</b>: one skin 6&frac12; × 3, portion of a green seal,
obscure. <b>Notes</b>: the form of the deed necessitates a date prior to 18 Edw I;
and it is only by the names of the persons mentioned in the charter that the
approximate date can be fixed. Mertone is an early form of Marton or Markeaton,
two miles north-west of Derby, Richard le Palmer was a witness to a lease of a
house in Markton (Markeaton) temp Edw I, see Jeayes &#x201c;Derbyshire Charters&#x201d;,
number 1651, page 205. The words &#x201c;about 1275&#x201d; are written on the back of the
charter, in a hand of later date.</p>

to have had a living in Norfolk. His eldest daughter Mary married Christopher
Wilson of Broomhead. William and Richard Ibotson were probably related to
John whose grandson Charles Wilson was vicar of Sheffield. See F.M.G. vol II,

<p class="gap2">Place-names, obvious in their meaning but suggesting a remote origin
and a forgotten past, attract the historian, if not the philologist.</p>

<p>Hawksyard is one of these; its import is Hawksland but its
history lies hidden in the records of past centuries; it excites our curiosity
and quickens our imagination.</p>

<p>We instinctively recall scenes of English sport in bygone days;
of kings and nobles, knights and ladies, riding across the unfenced country;
over moorland and waste, through fen and ford, with hooded falcon and
stooping hawk, enjoying what was for nearly a thousand years the
national sport of England.</p>

<p>Such a scene was brought to mind by the perusal of two musty
parchments with imposing seals and faded script, quarried from the
lower <i>strata</i> of time-worn muniments, in the office of Colonel Brooke
Taylor of Bakewell.</p>

<p>The earlier of these deeds takes us back to the death of John of
Gaunt and the resignation of Richard II in the closing year of the 14th
century; the later one was sealed and delivered in the less tragic days
of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>They both relate to Hawksyard, situate in that part of The Moorlands
of Staffordshire known in the middle ages as Highe Frith
of Malbanc Forest; south of Buxton and east of the church at Newtown
near Longnor.</p>

<p>The deed of John of Gaunt bears date the 15th May 1399, in bold
Arabic numerals; it is written in a jargon intended to be Latin and
measures 15 × 8&frac12; inches; its round pendent seal of green wax has a
diameter of three and a half inches and is nearly an inch thick. The
parchment is dark in colour, coarse in texture and much crinkled; the
writing is not uniform in character, parts being in a flowing hand
suggesting a date long subsequent to the Plantagenets. The deed begins
with the word <i>Conventum</i>, meaning a covenant or agreement under
seal; but, from the concluding paragraph, it was evidently intended to
operate as a deed of gift or grant in fee simple of the lands called
Hawksyard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not easy to give a true interpretation of this unconventional deed;
the operative part, which should be clear and precise, being vague and
inconclusive. The following is what may be accepted as a free translation
conveying a general idea of the purport and effect of the deed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An Agreement between John Gaunte duke of Lancaster, fourth son
of King Edward the third and Edward Mundy of Marton [Markeaton]
in the county of Derby knight. John Gaunt (<i>sic</i>) went himself
to visit Sir Edward Mundy at Marton in the county of Derby aforesaid
... and Sir Edward Mundy made a journey with the duke
of Lancaster and his attendants into Highe Frith in the parish of
Alstonefield in the county of Stafford; when they arrived at that
piece of public ground [? the common or moorland waste of the
manor] which was called Lady Edge, from which moorcock [both
red and black grouse] were frequently driven away and from whence
hawks were let loose and flown within such boundaries as were
thereinafter mentioned, to this boundary which was free and open
for birds flying backwards and forwards near the public road, which
led from Longnor to Leek. In the part of the circle in which the
hawks took [the grouse] near the middle circuit next the east clough,
on the 10th day of May 1399: for this reason John Gaunt gave it the
title and name of Hawksyerd otherwise Hawksearth, because of the
game being taken within its limits, thereinafter mentioned, which
place was not theretofore named, some other pieces of land, which
after that were made mention, to wit, part of a piece of land called
Harrisons Intake, part of a piece of land called House Fielde, on which
a small shed or house was standing, part of a piece of land called
Little Meadow, which on the south lay between a place called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Boothesley Grange and part of a piece of land called Rye Meadow
following the stream pointing west, part of a piece of land called
Killn Croffte adjoining the stream, thence west, part of a piece
of land called Spart (?) Meadow, part of a piece of land called Rye
Pingle, thence west following the rye of that year then growing. The
boundary of Hawksyard otherwise Hawksearth, lying and being in
Highe Frith in the parish of Alstonefield in the county of Stafford
set out by John Gaunte duke of Lancaster aforesaid, between such
bounds as were thereinafter mentioned, were set out for that house
only; and the land called Hawksyerd otherwise Hawksearth aforesaid,
where there is a clough at the east end of it and a purling
stream, thence south following the stream between that and a place
called Banke or otherwise Over Boothesley; also on the south side, a
clough and stream ran, thence east next the stream, between that
place called Bauthsley (<i>sic</i>) Grange and ascending on the south of
the piece of land which is called Rye Pingle, thence west leading
direct to the high ridge which is called Lady Edge, lying and being
in Highe Frithe in the parish of Alstonefield in the county of Stafford;
and then across the ridge which is north direct to the public road,
which led from Longnor to Leeke; and also along the public road
thence east it passed straight to the east end of the clough. The
full extent of the said land, in the 1st year of the reign of King
Henry IV, was marked out and set to limits either to expel, keep in
or admit, to the only proper use and advantage of that house called
Hawksyerd otherwise Hawksearth aforesaid; and also the liberty to
dig turf in the public meadow and wastes of the lordship of Alstonefield.
Sir Edward Mundy of Marton in the county of Derby aforesaid
prayed for one favour of John Gaunt duke of Lancaster, which he
[John] said he would consider if to him it were possible. Sir Edward
asked him and he [John] to him gave the said place called Hawksyerd
otherwise Hawksearth aforesaid and John Gaunt did freely give and
grant it to him and his descendants forever. Sir Edward Mundy then
went with his attendants to John Gaunt to see him at Lancaster
Castle which [agreement] John Gaunt sealed and subscribed; and
into the control of Sir Edward Mundy, all the before mentioned was
handed over on the 15th day of May 1399 In the presence of William
Stanley Gent, John Porter Gent, James Lewis Gent, Wi'm Stanley
Gent, Thomas Mundy Gent, John Thornicroft Attorney.</p></div>

<p>If this deed correctly records the facts, we must infer that John of
Gaunt owned lands in north Staffordshire between Longnor and Leek;
and that they probably formed part of the lands belonging to the duchy of
Lancaster. We learn that his friend Sir Edward Mundy of Markeaton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
twenty miles away to the south-east, invited the duke to visit him there;
a hawking party being arranged on the 10th May 1399 by Sir Edward
for the entertainment of his royal guest; one of the highest points of
The Moorlands, known as Lady Edge, nearly 1500 feet above the sea,
where grouse were always to be found, was selected as the trysting place.
The party would ride from Markeaton across the open country to Lady
Edge, and they appear to have had good sport. Probably John of Gaunt
and his friends from Markeaton watched the hawking from the top of
Lady Edge and the undulating land which lies between Lady Edge and
Hawksyard, the quarry being taken within a distance of half a mile
to the north-east. So pleased was the duke, that he honoured the place
where the hawks took their quarry by giving it the name of Hawksyard
otherwise Hawksearth; a place which before then was unnamed. The
deed also states that before the duke left Markeaton, Sir Edward asked
him as a personal favour to give Hawksyard to Sir Edward and that the
duke promised to consider the request. Apparently Sir Edward returned
with the duke to Lancaster, as a few days later the duke is stated to
have sealed and subscribed this deed at Lancaster Castle and delivered it
into the hands of Sir Edward on the 15th May 1399. The metes and
bounds are fully set forth in the deed, which also records that the
boundaries were marked out on the land in the 1st year of Henry IV.</p>

</div>

<p>The second deed bears date the 24th October 1568 written in the
same bold Arabic numerals as in the earlier deed; but the later deed is in
English and measures 16 × 12 inches, it has two round seals of yellow
wax, each of a diameter of one and a half inches; the impression on
these seals does not appear to be armorial but they both bear the same
form of cross; the parchment and make-up are in all respects similar
to the deed of 1399 and the signatures of Vincent Mundy and his son
are written in the same hand as the deed, which was not unusual in the
16th century.</p>

mentioned (that was to say) a clough at the east end of the said

John Weston his heirs and assigns full and peaceable possession etc.
The witnesses were John Walker, Thomas Mundye gent, Thomas
Brunt, John Oakes yeoman and Thomas Mundy (<i>sic</i>);</p></div>

<p>In this deed there is an evident desire on the part of the draftsman to
strengthen and even to extend the rights and privileges appurtenant to
the Hawksyard estate, which then included a house of considerable
importance, occupied by Ralph Bradbury and Maud his wife. Towards
the end of the deed a belated attempt at a recital of the earlier John of
Gaunt deed is added, with extracts giving the full description of the
boundaries; and this earlier deed is treated as the root of title to
Hawksyard.</p>

<p>The question and the only question we have to consider is whether
these two deeds give us a true account of the origin and early history
of the place-name Hawksyard? At first sight it would appear that
they do; but unfortunately there is much in the earlier deed to arouse
suspicion. It is not that the story of John of Gaunt&#x2019;s visit to
Highe Frith is improbable, on the contrary he rebuilt and occupied
Tutbury Castle twenty miles away; nor is there any reason to think
that in those days Sir Edward Mundy would hesitate to ask the duke
for a few acres of rough moorland waste, as a memento of a red-letter
day in the history of the Mundy family. Perhaps such a request, under
the circumstances, constituted true politeness in the middle ages; or he
may have wished to commemorate the day by building a house on the
land to bear the name Hawksyard; but, however probable these
surmises may be, there are many things in this alleged deed of gift
which suggest a date much later than the reign of Richard II and
cast a doubt as to its <i>bona fides</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place it is obvious that the date 15th May 1399 cannot
be correct, as John of Gaunt died in January or February 1398; further
the deed states that the duke visited Highe Frith on the 10th May
1399, which was impossible; and it is perhaps equally surprising to find
that a deed, dated in the reign of Richard II, should refer to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
year of Henry IV, whose reign had not then begun and might never
have occurred.</p>

<p>These impossible dates require explanation, but our difficulties do
not end with dates; the writing in the John of Gaunt deed is not
characteristic of the period, it is not uniform throughout, the body of
the deed being written in characters of the rugged native script, the names
of the witnesses being added in a flowing Italian hand of the Elizabethan
period. Attention should also be called to the fact, that of the five
witnesses in whose presence the duke is said to have affixed his seal,
not one of them was above the rank of gentleman. The seal is impressed
with a hunting horn, suggestive of forest heraldry, but the royal arms of
the son of Edward III do not appear on this seal; and, if the hunting
horn is in its proper heraldic position, the point of the shield is at the top.</p>

<p>As above stated, the form of the deed is unusual and follows no
precedent; many words are more suggestive of the classics than the
customary usage of diplomatics in the 14th century. <i>Equitem</i> takes
the place of the more conventional <i>militem</i>; <i>nuncupatur</i> is used instead
of <i>vocat</i> and <i>coram</i> instead of <i>testibus</i>. Each of the first four witnesses
is described as gent and the last as attorney, while Derby is written
once in English; further, the exact legal effect of the deed seems to
be intentionally vague; it is headed <i>conventum</i>, meaning a covenant, but
in the subsequent deed of 1568 it is referred to as a grant. The full
description of the land in the later deed, with all its boundaries and
appurtenant rights, suggests that the Elizabethan draftsman had some
doubt as to the true facts; these details being apparently exploited with
some ulterior intent.</p>

<p>In comparing the size make-up and general appearance of the
two deeds, it is impossible not to see in them a strong resemblance;
they are both typical of the time of Elizabeth, the deed of 1399 is
too large and too coarse for a charter of that date. The fact that one
is in Latin and the other in English makes the comparison less easy;
but in both we find similar parchment ink and seals; the script is much
the same in both deeds, each having the dates written in the same bold
Arabic numerals; and the later recites the earlier deed.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult to find other points of resemblance between
these deeds; and it is impossible to compare them without coming to
the conclusion that they were prepared at the same time by the same
person, with the definite object of making a good title to the Hawksyard
property, on the sale to John Weston.</p>

<p>This forces us to the conclusion that the John of Gaunt deed is
not altogether trustworthy; and we have to consider whether or not
the information it contains, with regard to the origin of the place-name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Hawksyard, can be relied on; or if we must treat its whole contents
as pure fiction and entirely discredit all it tells us of the hawking party
in Highe Frith.</p>

</div>

<p>There must be some explanation of this extraordinary deed; and it
may yet be possible to find a solution of the problem. Here is the deed!
How can we account for it? How much of what it tells us may we accept
as truth? To what extent is its story supported by extraneous evidence?</p>

<p>The points as to which we require information are; whether John
of Gaunt was in a position to give and grant lands in the Highe Frith
to Sir Edward Mundy or had he only the rights of an overlord? Why
did he hesitate before complying with Sir Edward&#x2019;s request? Was he
in doubt as to whether the land were his to give or whether he held
as tenant <i>in capite</i>? Did he execute a deed of gift or did the gift
rest on a verbal promise, Sir Edward taking possession of the lands
and converting them to his own use? Did the lawyer of 1568, who
carried through the sale to Weston, act <i>ex fide bona</i> and endeavour,
according to his lights and the practice of his time, to put the title to
Hawksyard in order, for the mutual benefit of both vendor and purchaser?</p>

<p>For answers to these questions we must return to the days of John
of Gaunt.</p>

<p>In 1398 Richard II, seeing that his uncle John of Gaunt was in
failing health and that John&#x2019;s son, Henry Bolingbroke earl of Hereford,
might press his claim to the throne of England in case of Richard&#x2019;s
death without issue, took advantage of a quarrel between Bolingbroke
and the duke of Norfolk, in which each accused the other of treason,
to banish them both from the realm.</p>

<p>The loss of his son fell heavily on John of Gaunt, who died at the
end of January or the beginning of February 1398; and it is important to
bear in mind that the year 1399 began on the 25th March and not
the 1st January.</p>

<p>Richard, being free for a time from the menace of the House of
Lancaster, seized the whole of the Lancastrian estates in the absence
of the banished heir and crossed to Ireland to complete his conquests
and strengthen his hold on that country.</p>

<p>During Richard&#x2019;s absence in Ireland the banished Henry, hearing
the news of his father&#x2019;s death and the confiscation of the Lancastrian
estates, landed on the Yorkshire coast with a few trusted friends and
three thousand men-at-arms.</p>

<p>He was at once joined by the great barons of the north and with
an army, which increased as it advanced, he ultimately reached London;
where he was well received by the people, who were tired of Richard
and looked to Henry as their future king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing the news of Henry&#x2019;s return Richard, after much delay
through rough weather, recrossed the Irish Channel to Milford Haven,
only to find that both his friends and his armies in England had melted
away and that his kingdom was lost.</p>

<p>He was forced by Henry and his supporters to resign his crown
and, in Westminster Hall on the 29th September 1399, his resignation
was received with shouts of applause; on the following day his cousin
Henry Bolingbroke, son and heir of John of Gaunt, was proclaimed King
of England as Henry IV.</p>

<p>On Henry&#x2019;s accession he regained the estates of the duchy of
Lancaster, which however remained in his hands as crown property.</p>

<p>The above events and the dates on which they occurred are of
importance in considering the two Hawksyard deeds; and if we are to
understand how and why they came into existence, we must also trace
the early history of Highe Frith and learn something of the conditions
then prevailing as to the holding and devolution of landed estates in
England; more especially with regard to earldoms honours and manors,
which formed the basis of the feudal system.</p>

<p>When we clearly understand the way in which land in England was
held in pre-reformation days, it will perhaps be possible to see whether
the facts set forth in the deed of gift of the 15th May 1399 were consistent
with the early history of the manor of Alstonefield; and whether John
of Gaunt was shortly before his death in a legal position to comply
with the request of Sir Edward Mundy.</p>

<p>As already stated Hawksyard was in Highe Frith, part of the
manor of Alstonefield, and a manor was an estate in fee simple in a
tract of land granted by the sovereign to a subject, usually a man of
some consequence, in consideration of certain services.</p>

<p>He was the lord of the manor and he reserved for his own use
such parts of the land as he required, which were called the demesne
lands; other parts he granted out to his tenants, under varying conditions
which included estates of inheritance, estates for life, for years and at
will; the barren lands which remained in his hands were what was known
as the commons and wastes of the manor or the foreign lands. The
whole formed a manor or lordship which had its own courts and customs
and enjoyed feudal privileges, which extended not only to the lands
held by tenants but also to the commons and waste lands.</p>

<p>When many manors, perhaps extending into several counties, were
held by one great baron or overlord they formed an honour which was
held of the king <i>in capite</i>; this was quite different in character to the
manor. It was a jurisdiction, vested in private hands, and not a territorial
possession; the lords of the manors retaining their separate manorial
organisation and rendering suit and service to their overlord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Manors also formed part of the earldom or shire; for some time after
the conquest an earl also had the title of count and from the counts
the shires took the name of counties. The title however soon disappeared
in England but we still retain countess, county and viscount.</p>

<p>When a great earldom honour or manor fell by forfeiture or escheat
into the hands of the sovereign which constantly happened, it retained its
distinct corporate existence and the whole apparatus of jurisdiction or
tenure. Under its own title it either continued in the possession of the
sovereign or was granted out again as a hereditary fief.</p>

<p>The manor of Alstonefield appears to have been included in different
earldoms and different honours at different dates, prior to the time when
it came into the hands of John of Gaunt and his first wife&#x2019;s ancestors.</p>

<p>At the taking of the Domesday survey in 1086, Alstonefield manor
was held as a knight&#x2019;s fee by Robert count of Shrewsbury with William
de Malbanc under him as lord of the manor. The Shrewsbury overlordship
did not last long and Alstonefield, which seems to have been much
in request, possibly owing to its grouse moor, was transferred to the
honour of Chester under Hugh Lupus; to whom William had, three
years after the conquest, given the earldom of Chester and William
de Malbanc, of Wich Malbanc now Nantwich, held the position of lord
marcher under Lupus, so that the lordship of Alstonefield formed part of
the marchlands or boundaries of the honour of Chester on the east,
over which William de Malbanc would have supreme control as lord of
the marches.</p>

<p>That part of the manor which lay between Leek and the river Dove,
including the site of Hawksyard, was chiefly forest and moorland; shortly
after the conquest and for many centuries after, it was known as Malbanc
Forest; but in 1220 the Malbanc barony devolved on three co-heiresses,
who held Alstonefield in co-parcenary.</p>

<p>On the forfeiture of a third share by the eldest daughter, then
countess of Warwick, it came into the possession of Hugh le Despencer,
though how he got it is not clear, and this share included the tract of
barren moorland known as Highe Frith of Malbanc Forest.</p>

<p>In 1297, on the death of Edmund earl of Lancaster, the King&#x2019;s
Escheator held an inquisition at Tutbury for the county of Lancaster,
to ascertain what knight&#x2019;s fees were due to the earl; the jury found
<i>inter alia</i> that Hugh le Despencer held one knight&#x2019;s fee in the manor
of Altonesfelt (Alstonefield) worth yearly in homages etc. £10. &#x201c;Nomina
Villarum&#x201d; 1316 gives Hugh le Despencer and Nicholas de Audeleye
as owners of Alstonefield, a vill in the liberty of the earl of Lancaster,
who had the return of all writs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1322 the estates of le Despencer were forfeited to the crown
and subsequently bestowed by Edward III on Henry earl of Lancaster,
grandfather of Blanche the wife of John of Gaunt.</p>

<p>It may be helpful here to recall how John of Gaunt was created
duke of Lancaster and became possessed of the Lancastrian estates,
extending into Cheshire, Staffordshire and other counties.</p>

<p>The first earl of Lancaster was Edmund called Crouchback second
son of Henry III; in addition to his Lancastrian estates, his father
bestowed on him the earldoms of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury
and Chester.</p>

<p>These passed on his death in 1296 to his eldest son Thomas earl
of Lancaster, who was beheaded at Pontefract in 1322 when his estates
were forfeited to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> His widow was allowed to retain the
Salisbury estate; and the other four earldoms were bestowed on his
brother Henry earl of Lancaster, to whom one third share of Alstonefield
manor was also given, so that he possessed not only the Lancastrian
estates but also the earldoms of Derby (including the honour of Tutbury),
Leicester, Lincoln, Chester and the territorial interest of a third of the
manor of Alstonefield, including Malbanc Forest; of which Highe
Frith was waste of the manor.</p>

<p>Henry earl of Lancaster was succeeded by his son Henry, afterwards
first duke of Lancaster, who had no son; of his two daughters, Maud
married William of Bavaria and Blanche married John of Gaunt. Maud
died without issue, whereupon the whole of the Lancastrian estates
devolved on Blanche; and, in right of his wife, on her husband John
of Gaunt, who was in 1362 created duke of Lancaster.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the seal attached to the deed of gift
of the 15th May 1399 bears a hunting horn; and in order to find some
explanation of this seal it may be necessary to glance for a moment
at the history of the honour of Tutbury, which as we have seen was
included in the earldom of Derby and passed to John of Gaunt
with that earldom.</p>

" title="" />
<b>The Tutbury Horn</b>, from a photograph in the reference library at Sheffield.
</div>

<p>About the end of the 13th century, the important office of escheator
and coroner throughout the whole honour of Tutbury within the county
of Stafford, was claimed by Walter Agard who demanded to hold office
by right of inheritance; but he was unable to produce any written
evidence in support of his claim; and in lieu of charters or writings,
he produced a white hunting horn garnished with silver-gilt in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and at both ends, to which was affixed a girdle of black silk adorned
with buckles of silver, on which was placed the <i>insignia</i> of Edmund
earl of Lancaster; this horn was offered and accepted as the charter and
evidence of title to the office of escheator and coroner, to which he made
claim.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to follow the devolution of the Tutbury Horn
from Walter Agard; but in the 17th century, on the marriage of an
heiress of Agard, it passed to the Stanhopes, who sold it with its offices in
1753 to Samuel Foxlow of Staveley Hall, from him it ultimately passed
to Henry Marwood Greaves of Banner Cross, Sheffield, and Ford Hall,
Derbyshire, who once only exercised the right of appointment; and on
his death in 1859 his eldest son William Henry Greaves, who had
assumed the surname of Greaves-Bagshawe in 1853, succeeded to the
horn by inheritance, and appointed the next succeeding coroner. We
shall have to consider whether the pendent seal of the alleged deed of
gift can in any way be accounted for by the fact, that the honour of
Tutbury was part of the duchy of Lancaster prior to John of Gaunt&#x2019;s
death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">

<b>Seals</b> of 24th October 1568.
</div>

<p>Let us now turn to the other party to the deed of gift, Sir Edward
Mundy.</p>

<p>In Burke&#x2019;s &#x201c;Commoners of England&#x201d; 1836, it is suggested that the
Mundy family derived its name from Mondaye Abbey in the dukedom
of Normandy; and it may be, that Sir Edward Mundy or his father
fought with John of Gaunt in the wars with France and Spain.</p>

<p>It seems probable, from what we find in the earlier deed, that the
duke and Sir Edward were close personal friends; and it may possibly
have been through the influence of John of Gaunt, that Sir Edward
Mundy or his father settled near Derby. However that may be, we
are told that Sir Edward entertained the duke at Markeaton and returned
with him to Lancaster Castle.</p>

<p>Vincent Mundy of Markeaton was a justice of the peace for the
county of Derby in 1558 and his son Edward died in 1607.</p>

<p>Burke also tells us that &#x201c;from old deeds in existence it appears
that the family held lands in the year 1399&#x201d;; it may be and seems highly
probable that he was referring to the deed of gift and the grant above
described, to which he presumably had access and gave credence.</p>

<p>On the other hand the two Lysons, in their work on Derbyshire,
say that the Mundys did not buy the Markeaton property until the
beginning of the sixteenth century. Perhaps at that date they added
to their original holding?</p>

<p>We now have some idea of how matters stood in 1399 and 1568;
we are therefore in a better position to consider whether the deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Richard II and Elizabeth can be relied on as giving the origin and
early history of the place-name Hawksyard.</p>

<p>Assuming for the moment that the two deeds were prepared at
the same time and by the same hand, it is necessary to consider the
position as it presented itself to the attorney, who in 1568 was instructed
to carry out the sale of Hawksyard to John Weston. He possibly may
have acted for both vendor and purchaser and been anxious to do his
best for both his clients. He would, on receiving his instructions, ask
the vendor for his title deeds; the answer would presumably be that
there were no such deeds; but it was probably well known in the
vendor&#x2019;s family and possibly also to John Weston, that Hawksyard
had been given to Sir Edward Mundy by John of Gaunt shortly before
his death, after enjoying a day&#x2019;s hawking in Highe Frith, the tradition
of which would hang round The Moorlands for centuries; perhaps letters
or diaries would be produced with sufficient detail to satisfy the purchaser
of the truth of the tradition.</p>

<p>The attorney would perhaps be in doubt, whether this traditional
gift was a grant of the fee simple or a mere sporting right over certain
waste lands belonging to the manor of Alstonefield, part of the duchy;
which right would be what is known as a right of common in gross.
The vendors were doubtless in actual possession and their ancestors
had held it for nearly two hundred years; under circumstances such as
these the Courts of Common Law, in the absence of the tradition, would
have assumed a lost grant, made prior to the reign of Richard I, which
is supposed to be equivalent to immemorial user; but the family tradition
as to John of Gaunt fixes the lost grant in the reign of Richard II, which
would not support a claim by immemorial user. Under these circumstances
and in the absence of any title deeds, the attorney seems to have
taken upon himself the responsibility of creating a root of title, based
on the tradition and possibly what he considered satisfactory recorded
evidence; in doing this he exercised neither artfulness nor skill. He
hesitated whether to make it an agreement or a grant, he neglected to
use the 14th century common form of such a document, he blundered
sadly in the dates, and he referred in the deed, which he dated in the
reign of Richard II, to a reign which had not then begun. There would
be a difficulty as to the witnesses, and it may be that those named were
taken from some deed of 1399 to which he had access, notwithstanding
the fact that these five witnesses were not suitable or likely witnesses
for the sealing by John of Gaunt; there was also the difficulty of the
seal, and as probably no seal of John of Gaunt was available, a forest
seal, perhaps of the honour of Tutbury, was used; Alstonefield manor
being within that honour, and the deed of the 15th May 1399 was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
result; which did well enough to hand to the purchaser, as the root
of title to Hawksyard, along with his conveyance from Vincent Mundy
and his son. Even if the parties to the transaction knew of what was
being done they would doubtless be well pleased to have the John of
Gaunt tradition put on record; and the enterprising attorney would
probably be thanked and well paid for his trouble and resource. There
does not appear to have been any fraudulent intention to improperly
acquire any land or other benefit, though such a counterfeit in these days
would be fraught with risk to all parties concerned; but in the time
of Elizabeth, the law of real property rested less on statute and more
on the unwritten law; which was interpreted and applied loosely and
without supervision.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The effect of this <i>ex post facto</i> apograph was
twofold and benefited both sides. The vendors put on permanent record
their treasured family tradition and the purchaser got a root of title,
which might be of value to him in case of re-sale. It would be interesting
to know why the Mundys barred the entail and sold Hawksyard, with its
sporting tradition; it may have been that the chancellor of the duchy
had, at a then recent date, raised the question as to whether the Mundy
family originally had an estate in fee simple or a right of common in
gross; and that they as owners thought they would act wisely in selling to
a purchaser for value.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason may have been for the sale of Hawksyard
in 1568, it passed by the deed of Elizabeth from the Mundy family
to John Weston of Mackworth, and is now held and enjoyed under
prescriptive right, which makes its past history of little consequence,
so far as the present owner, Mr Robert Shirley of Waterhouse Farm,
near Longnor, is concerned.</p>

<p>His numerous deeds and papers relating to Hawksyard include an
abstract of title beginning in the 14th year of Elizabeth (10th July 1572),
when John Weston and Katherine his wife sold Hawksyard to Ralph
Bradbury who, as appears from the grant to John Weston, was in 1568
the tenant of Hawksyard; so that John Weston owned the property for
less than four years and then sold it to his tenant Ralph Bradbury,
who in May 1573 settled it on his younger son Otwell.</p>

<p>Forty-two years later, on the 11th May 1615, Otwell Bradbury
and Ralph his son and heir sold Hawksyard to Henry Cock for £400.
For many years the estate remained in the possession of the Cock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
family, who sold it to Ralph Wood of Leek Abbey, the Cistercian
monastery Dieu-la-Cresse, and on the 5th April 1800 Hawksyard passed
into the possession of John Shirley of Rewlach, the great grandfather
of the present owner.</p>

<p>In 1850 some closes, part of Hawksyard, lying on the west side
of the road leading from Newtown to Warslow, were exchanged for
adjacent closes, part of the late Sir John Harpur Crewe&#x2019;s estates. With
this exception, the Hawksyard estate seems to follow the boundaries
set forth in the deed of 1399, and Harrison&#x2019;s Intake, Low Meadow, Rye
Meadow, Kiln Croft and Spout Field of that date still exist and appear
in the description of the lands in the 19th century title deeds. On the
front of the house are two dates, one above the other, the lower one
is &#x201c;H C 1620&#x201d; and the upper one is &#x201c;H C 1784&#x201d;; both these dates occur
during the ownership of the Cock family, and the initials &#x201c;H C&#x201d; probably
indicate Henry Cock.</p>

<p>Hawksyard of to-day is a substantial farmstead of eighty acres, with
a good house and farm buildings occupied by Mr Shirley&#x2019;s son Edwin
Leslie Shirley; it is bounded on every side by lands of Sir Vauncey
Harpur Crewe of Calke Abbey and Warslow Hall, but it has never
formed part of the encircling Harpur estate, which we may assume
was crown property; and the grant to the Harpurs of these surrounding
lands may have given rise to a discussion as to the Hawksyard title, and
possibly suggested to the Mundys the desirability of the sale to Weston.
If the surrounding lands were granted by the crown, leaving Hawksyard
an isolated and independent holding, there seems to have been a recognition
of the Mundy title and a strong vindication of the Hawksyard tradition.</p>

<p>Of the places referred to in the deeds, Boothesley (now spelt Boosley)
Grange still stands; Bank or Over Boothesley is now Bank House and
the &#x201c;pearle of water&#x201d; is Boosley Brook. Highe Frith and Malbanc
Forest are not on the ordnance map and are almost forgotten in the
district; but Lady Edge is still in daily use, and the existence to-day
of these medieval place-names seems to strengthen the probability of the
story of John of Gaunt&#x2019;s visit to the Highe Frith.</p>

<p>If ramblers on foot and on wheels, when passing the east end of
the church and the adjoining school of Newtown, will stop for a
moment to glance down on Hawksyard, two fields to the east and
up to Lady Edge half a mile to the south-west; it will not be difficult to
reconstruct the scene of the hawking, when</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
